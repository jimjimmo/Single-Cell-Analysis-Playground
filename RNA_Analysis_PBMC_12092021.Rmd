#Load the PBMC dataset
pbmc.data <- Read10X(data.dir = "C:/Users/jimbo/Documents/R")
#Initialize the Seurat object with the raw (non-normalized data)

pbmc <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = pbmc.data, project = "pbmc3k", min.cells = 3, min.features = 200)

pbmc

#Add columns to the metadata using pbmc[[]]. Double bracket is useful for adding information
pbmc[["percent.mt"]] <- PercentageFeatureSet(pbmc, pattern = "^MT-")

VlnPlot(pbmc, features = c("nCount_RNA", "nFeature_RNA","percent.mt"), ncol = 3)

#After the Violin Plot, we can inspect the data and QC it. In this case, data looks good enough so no need to QC
